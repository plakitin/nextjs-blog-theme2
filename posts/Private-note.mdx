Private Note enables users to send messages through links with options that allow notes to be deleted after they are read. It also provides tools to track when, where, and on which device a message has been accessed, adding an extra layer of control over information sharing.

This service supports a variety of uses, from monitoring message interactions to securely transmitting sensitive data that requires automatic removal. Its flexible settings make it a practical choice for those needing both privacy and insight into message delivery.

## Main Features of Private Note

### Flexible Timing for Note Removal

Users can specify when a note should be deleted after being accessed. Options include immediate removal after reading, or delays ranging from one minute to one week. This flexibility suits different needs, allowing sensitive data to be erased promptly or giving the reader additional time to review the content.

### Gathering Detailed Access Information

The service records comprehensive data about each note opening. It tracks the reader's IP address, geographic location, device type, operating system, and browser. This information helps identify who accessed the note and provides insights into recipient behavior.

## Examples of Using Private Note

### Delivering Temporary Codes and Sensitive Details

Private Note allows sending one-time passwords or confidential data securely. The sender can monitor when and where the note is accessed. Information is deleted automatically according to predefined settings to ensure privacy.

### Monitoring Engagement with Shared Content

It enables tracking how quickly a recipient views a message by sending a note link. Timing data helps determine if the message was seen, assisting in evaluating the interest of clients or partners. This supports more informed follow-up actions.

### Managing Access to Critical Information

Sensitive data like financial or commercial details can be shared with controlled access. Notes can be set to expire after the first read or after a certain time. Analytics provide insights about who opened the note and from what location.
